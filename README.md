This visualisation dives into an open source data from Buzzfeed newsroom (Pham,2018). Buzzfeed analysed film scripts of Best Picture Nominees from three years 1989,2015 and 2017 to check if it has become diverse following the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag. This analysis involved extracting written dialogue to identify actors with their genders and race and even the number of words/sentences they spoke (Vo and Pham,2018)
